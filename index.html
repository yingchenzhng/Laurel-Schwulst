        <h1>My Website is a Shifting House next to a River of Knowledge. What could yours be?</h1>
        <h2>Laurel Schwultz</h2>

        <h3>What is a Website?</h3>
        <p>A website is a beautifully crafted collection of digital experiences hosted on remote servers.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A server, always connected to the internet, breathes life into a website.</li>
            <li>A domain name, an elegant piece of language, directs users to this digital masterpiece.</li>
            <li>An IP address, a string of numbers, serves as its secret address.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Duality of Website:</h3>
        <p>They are both subject and object at once. A website creator becomes both author and architect, shaping digital worlds.</p>

        <h3>Why make a Website?</h3>
        <p>They empower creators to fashion not only digital creations but entire immersive experiences, with infinite possibilities.</p>

        <h3>What can a Website be?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>As a room: it is a finite, purposeful space.</li>
            <li>As a shelf: a curated collection of digital artifacts.</li>
            <li>As a plant: growing organically over time.</li>
            <li>As a garden: ever-changing, tending to ideas.</li>
            <li>As a puddle: a transient reflection of creative thoughts.</li>
            <li>As a thrown rock that's now falling deep into the ocean: a creation released into the vast digital world.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Response:</h3>
        <p>In her article, Laurel Schwulst ponders the essence of a website in the ever-evolving digital landscape. She defines websites as beautifully crafted collections of digital experiences hosted on remote servers, underlining their diverse potential for conveying emotions and messages. Schwulst encourages individuals, particularly artists, to craft personal websites, considering them as spaces for creative expression and contributions to a more inclusive and diverse web. She explores metaphors such as websites as rooms, shelves, plants, gardens, puddles, or thrown rocks to highlight their dynamic and evolving nature. Schwulst advocates for a shift in how we perceive the internet, viewing it as a canvas for endless possibilities and individual responsibility in shaping a better web.</p>
